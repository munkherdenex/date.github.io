# Fun Date Invitation Webpage

[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live%20Site-Visit-blue)](https://munkherdenex.github.io/date.github.io/)

A playful and interactive webpage built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!  
This project asks "Do you want to go on a date with me?" â€” but clicking "No" is impossible because the button keeps moving around.  
If you click "Yes," it automatically schedules a meeting date based on the current time in Ulaanbaatar

## About

This project was created for fun while practicing DOM manipulation, event handling, dynamic styling, and random positioning in JavaScript.  
It also calculates a future date dynamically based on the user's local time adjusted for Ulaanbaatar time (GMT+8).

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## Features
- Interactive moving "No" button to avoid clicks
- "Yes" button that calculates and displays a future meeting date
- Animated floating heart effects
- Responsive for different screen sizes

## How It Works
- When you try to click "No," the button randomly jumps to a different position.
- Clicking "Yes" shows a date 2 days from today, based on Ulaanbaatar time.
- Floating heart animations appear periodically on the screen.
